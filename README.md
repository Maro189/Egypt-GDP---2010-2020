# Egypt-GDP---2010-2020
This is a simple project to start my journey in data analysis.
I gathered the data from worldbank.com. where it was sorted and manipulated in jupyter notebooks.
2 graphs were made to represent the data. An animated bar graph which shows each ecnonomic sector's overall contribution to Egypt's GDP.
as well as a line graph charting Egypt's GDP from 2010 to 2022 (USD).
Dashboard was also uploaded to Tableau public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marwan7594/viz/GDPunemploymentAnalysisofEgypt2010-2020/Dashboard1?publish=yes
